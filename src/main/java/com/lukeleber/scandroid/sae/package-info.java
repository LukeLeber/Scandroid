/**
 * Implementations of various related ISO/SAE standards can be found within this package.  Each
 * implementation resides in its own "sub-package" and exists somewhat independently except for
 * occasions where various standards explicitly link and/or refer to each other.  For example,
 * SAE J1979 (Diagnostic Test Modes) refers to SAE J2012 (Diagnostic Trouble Codes) such that
 * DTCs defined by J2012 are included in J1979.
