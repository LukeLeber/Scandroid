# Scandroid
The free scan tool for Android.

Scandroid allows you to communicate with your 1996 and newer vehicle with any bluetooth enabled android powered device.  Based upon SAE-J1979, the following diagnostic test modes are currently supported:

1) Query and review the live data of your vehicle
2) Query and review the freeze-frame data of your vehicle
3) Read and display diagnostic trouble codes stored in your vehicle
4) Reset diagnostic information stored in your vehicle

The default interpreter hardware utilized by Scandroid is the ELM327 that is available from www.elmelectronics.com.  Personally, I purchased the ELM327 OBDII < - > RS232 adapter with additional bluetooth hardware for wireless communication.
